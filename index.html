          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
          Hello! I’m Jimothy, a passionate Computer Science sophomore at Buena Vista University with a deep curiosity for technology and innovation. As I continue my studies, I’ve developed a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software engineering principles. My academic journey so far has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex problems and build efficient, scalable solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
          Beyond the classroom, I’ve immersed myself in various projects and internships that have honed my practical experience. From developing web applications to contributing to open-source projects, I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge. My recent project involved creating a machine learning model to predict market trends, which sparked my interest in data science and AI.
          </p>
          <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I’m a collaborative team player who values clear communication and creative problem-solving. When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, attending hackathons, or indulging in a good sci&#8209;fi novel. I’m excited about the future and eager to contribute to impactful projects that drive technological advancement.
